# CS211 - Operating System 
**If you are a person on the internet going through this, don't take this as a reliable knowledge source.**

This repository contains my assignments, programs, and project for CS211 - Operating System course at Fulbright University Vietnam, Fall 2024. 

All explanations are my attempt at consolidating my learning and reflect my current understanding of the matter. If you are a person on the internet going through this, don't take this as a reliable knowledge source. You are better off believing in the sources I link & sources you see elsewhere. 

~~I will try to come back and update if I find out I'm wrong. But I might not be able to do that soon enough--or at all.~~ I cannot edit the content beyond the assignment submission deadline.

The best way to write the assignments is in Markdown, and the most accessible way of publishing Markdown is GitHub.
